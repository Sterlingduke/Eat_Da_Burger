This is a simple restaurant app that allows the user to ass burgers to a list through the form. Once they have submitted their burger, it will be added to the "The Uneaten Burgers...Let's Start" list. When the user clicks on "eat up" button for particular burger, it will be removed from the list and added to the "Damn Good Burger....All Gone!" list. the application is deployed on Heroku, and uses Node, Express, and Handlebars to generatethe html, styling, and function of the page.
